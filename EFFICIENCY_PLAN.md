# Efficiency Improvement Plan

This document outlines a plan to improve the efficiency of the Dhruv project, focusing on build and deploy performance and the developer workflow.

## 1. Build & Deploy Performance

The current CI/CD pipeline is well-structured, but there are opportunities to improve its performance.

### Recommendations

*   **Parallelize Build and Deploy:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline to run the build and deploy steps in parallel. This will significantly reduce the overall deployment time.
*   **Cache Dependencies:** Use a caching mechanism, such as a dependency cache, to avoid reinstalling dependencies on every build. This will speed up the build process and reduce network traffic.

## 2. Developer Workflow

The developer workflow is already quite good, but there are a few things that could be done to improve it even further.

### Recommendations

*   **Implement Pre-commit Hooks:** Use a tool like Husky to set up pre-commit hooks that run the linter and tests before any code is committed. This will help to ensure that all code is of a high quality and that all tests are passing.
*   **Add a `dev:fast` Script:** Create a `dev:fast` script that starts the development server with hot reloading and a mock API. This will allow developers to quickly iterate on changes without having to wait for the entire application to build.

## 3. Runtime Performance

The project already has a robust performance monitoring setup using Lighthouse and Axe-core in the CI pipeline. This is a great foundation for ensuring a fast and accessible user experience.

### Recommendations

*   **Optimize Images:** Use Next.js's built-in Image component to automatically optimize images for different screen sizes and devices.
*   **Code Splitting:** Use dynamic imports to code-split the application and only load the JavaScript that is needed for the current page.
*   **Use a Caching Strategy:** Implement a caching strategy, such as Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) or server-side rendering with caching, to reduce the time it takes to render pages.

By implementing these recommendations, you can significantly improve the efficiency of the Dhruv project.
