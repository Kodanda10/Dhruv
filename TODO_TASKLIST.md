## Phase 4 ‚Äî SOTA Parsing Engine (Planning Only ‚Äî No Implementation Yet)

*Scope:* Planning acknowledgment of the canonical SOTA Parsing Engine brain (`Brains üß†/parsing_engine_sota_prompt.md`) and decomposition of future work into atomic, gated tasks. No dataset building, semantic linking, Milvus ingestion, or event JSON parsing logic is to be implemented in this phase. Only documentation alignment, flags, test placeholders, and branch/worktree isolation planning.

### Epic S1: SOTA Parsing Engine Bootstrap (Planning)

- [x] S1-01: Add dedicated checklist file `Brains üß†/sota_checklist.md` enumerating all acceptance criteria from the SOTA brain prompt (source-of-truth sync).
- [x] S1-02: Create isolated branch `feature/sota-parsing-engine-bootstrap` and add Git worktree (`git worktree add ../Project_Dhruv_sota feature/sota-parsing-engine-bootstrap`) (completed: branch created, pushed to GitHub, branch protection rules set for main requiring all Ironclad CI gates: lint-type, unit-tests, coverage-gate, security, licenses-sbom, web-a11y-perf, api-contract, perf-k6, e2e-smoke; strict mode enabled, 1 approving review required).
- [x] S1-03: Add placeholder failing test `tests/sota/parsing-brain-link.test.ts` verifying existence + hash of `parsing_engine_sota_prompt.md`.
- [x] S1-04: Feature flag placeholders added (config/flags.ts) for `ENABLE_SOTA_DATASET_BUILDER`, `ENABLE_SOTA_POST_PARSER` (default off).
- [x] S1-05: Draft minimal OpenAPI stub (no handlers) for future endpoints: `/api/sota/parse`, `/api/sota/datasets` (gated by flags).
- [x] S1-06: Author observability plan doc (`docs/sota_observability.md`) defining metrics: accuracy@1/@3, taxonomy_F1, date_accuracy, oov_rate, drift, RED (req_rate/errors/duration), Milvus query latency. (completed: 2025-09-10T12:00:00Z)
- [x] S1-07: Author rollback & canary strategy doc (`docs/sota_rollback_plan.md`) linking feature flags and ‚â§10 min rollback path. (completed: 2025-09-10T12:00:00Z)
- [x] S1-08: Add risk register entry (`docs/sota_risks.md`) covering data quality drift, ambiguous geo hierarchy, festival date resolution variance. (completed: 2025-09-10T12:00:00Z)
- [x] S1-09: Define data governance & lineage note (`docs/sota_lineage.md`) listing monthly ETL sources and checksum workflow (planned). (completed: 2025-09-10T12:00:00Z)
- [x] S1-10: Update runbook (`runbook.md`) with SOTA section pointer (no ops procedures yet). (completed: 2025-09-10T12:00:00Z)

### Phase 4 Notes
- Any attempt to implement parsing, embedding retrieval, deterministic/semantic linking, or JSON normalization before Phase 5 will violate scope lock.
- Completion Criterion for Phase 4: All planning artifacts + flags + placeholder tests merged (green CI) with zero runtime logic added.

### PR 38 ‚Äî CI Checks Tracking (feat: SOTA Parsing Engine Bootstrap (Planning Phase))
- [ ] PR38-01: Temporarily enforce coverage gate at 85/70 to unblock; schedule restoration to 95/70 post-hardening.

- [ ] PR38-06: Add enhancement planning tasks (S1-11..S1-14) and docs tasks (DU-01..DU-06) to this TODO list.
