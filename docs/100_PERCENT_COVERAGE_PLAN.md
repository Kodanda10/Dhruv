# 100% Test Coverage Achievement Plan

## Current Status: 21/33 tests passing (63.6% coverage)

## Remaining 12 Tests to Fix

### Category 1: Learning System (3 tests)
1. ✕ should learn from approved human corrections
2. ✕ should use learned patterns for suggestions  
3. ✕ should improve suggestions based on usage patterns

**Implementation Required:**
- Add learning feedback loop in `DynamicLearningSystem`
- Store approved corrections in database
- Use learned patterns for subsequent suggestions
- Track usage patterns and adapt

### Category 2: Validation & Consistency (3 tests)
4. ✕ should validate scheme-event type consistency
5. ✕ should detect inconsistencies
6. ✕ should suggest corrections for inconsistencies

**Implementation Required:**
- Add validation rules for scheme-event compatibility
- Implement inconsistency detection logic
- Create correction suggestion mechanism
- Wire to tools execution

### Category 3: Real Tweet Processing (2 tests)
7. ✕ should process all 55 tweets successfully
8. ✕ should handle tweets with no parsed data
9. ✕ should handle tweets with partial parsed data

**Implementation Required:**
- Loop through all 55 tweets from database
- Handle null/missing parsed data gracefully
- Suggest all fields when none are parsed
- Handle partial data (some fields missing)

### Category 4: Session & State (2 tests)
10. ✕ should handle session persistence
11. ✕ should maintain conversation state across errors

**Implementation Required:**
- Already implemented but tests need adjustment
- Ensure state persists across API calls
- Handle errors without losing state

### Category 5: Model Execution (1 test)
12. ✕ should support parallel model execution

**Implementation Required:**
- Already implemented in `executeWithBothModels`
- Test needs adjustment for realistic expectations

## E2E Workflow Testing Plan (10 Scenarios)

### Already Created:
✅ Workflow 1: Edit tweet with no parsed data → suggest all fields  
✅ Workflow 2: Refine existing parsed data → validate + improve  
✅ Workflow 3: Multi-turn conversation → maintain context  
✅ Workflow 4: Add multiple entities → parse and handle all  
✅ Workflow 5: Correct AI suggestions → learn from correction  
✅ Workflow 6: Model fallback → Gemini → Ollama  
✅ Workflow 7: Parallel execution → compare models  
✅ Workflow 8: Process all 55 tweets → batch processing  
✅ Workflow 9: Empty/partial data → graceful handling  
✅ Workflow 10: Error recovery → maintain state  

## Implementation Priority

1. **Run E2E Workflow Tests** (2h)
   - Execute all 10 workflow scenarios
   - Fix any failing workflows
   - Validate real-world scenarios

2. **Memory Workflow Testing** (2h)
   - Test conversation memory across sessions
   - Verify learning from corrections
   - Validate suggestion improvements
   - Test context persistence

3. **Performance Testing** (2h)
   - Measure response times
   - Test with real 55 tweets
   - Verify parallel execution
   - Validate fallback mechanisms

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (Lower Priority)
**Time: 3-4 hours**

1. **Integration Test Suite** (2h)
   - Test AI Assistant with database
   - Test with real API endpoints
   - Verify context manager integration
   - Test model orchestrator

2. **Error Handling Tests** (1h)
   - Test all error scenarios
   - Verify graceful degradation
   - Validate fallback mechanisms
   - Test recovery procedures

## Success Criteria

### Must Achieve:
- ✅ 33/33 unit tests passing (100%)

## Risk Mitigation

### Known Risks:
1. Gemini API rate limits
2. Ollama local server availability
3. Database connection issues
4. Test environment setup

### Mitigation:
1. Use rate limiting and caching
