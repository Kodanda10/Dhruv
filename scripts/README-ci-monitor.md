# CI Monitor for Ironclad CI

A continuous CI monitoring script that runs in the background and provides real-time status updates with notifications.

## Features

- üöÄ **Real-time Monitoring**: Checks CI status every 30 seconds
- üé® **Color-coded Status**: Green for success, red for failure, blue for running
- üì¢ **Smart Notifications**: Only notifies on status changes (red ‚Üí green, green ‚Üí red, etc.)
- üìã **Detailed Job Status**: Shows individual job statuses in verbose mode
- üîî **System Notifications**: Sends macOS notifications when status changes
- ‚èπÔ∏è **Clean Exit**: Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
npm run ci:monitor
```

### Direct Script Execution
```bash
./scripts/ci-monitor.sh
```

### Background Monitoring
```bash
./scripts/ci-monitor.sh &
```

## Configuration

The script can be customized by editing the configuration variables at the top of `ci-monitor.sh`:

```bash
INTERVAL=30           # Check every 30 seconds
NOTIFICATION_ENABLED=true  # Enable/disable notifications
VERBOSE=true         # Show detailed job information
```

## Status Indicators

- ‚úÖ **All Green**: All CI checks passed successfully
- ‚ùå **Failed**: One or more CI checks failed
- ‚è≥ **Running**: CI is currently in progress
- ‚ùì **Unknown**: Unable to determine status
- üì≠ **No Runs**: No CI runs found

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated
- Must be run from within a git repository
- Repository must have the `ironclad.yml` workflow

## Notifications

The script automatically sends notifications when CI status changes:

- **Success**: "CI is now all green! ‚úÖ"
- **Failure**: "CI has failed! ‚ùå Check the details above."
- **Started**: "CI run has started"

On macOS, notifications use the system notification center if `terminal-notifier` is available.

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub CLI Not Found
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

### No Repository Access
```bash
# Ensure you're authenticated and in the correct repository
gh auth status
git remote -v
```

### No CI Runs Found
- Check that the repository has the `ironclad.yml` workflow
- Ensure CI has been triggered at least once
- Verify the workflow file exists in `.github/workflows/ironclad.yml`

## Integration with Development Workflow

Add to your development scripts in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "ci:monitor": "./scripts/ci-monitor.sh",
    "dev:ci": "npm run dev & npm run ci:monitor"
  }
}
```

This allows you to monitor CI while developing locally.
