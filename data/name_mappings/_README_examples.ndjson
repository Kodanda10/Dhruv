{"_doc":"2) For each missing entry, research official Hindi spellings, add a curated line here (hindi + nukta_hindi), and commit"}
{"_doc":"3) Re-run the builder; it will use the curated mapping and stop flagging the name as missing"}
{"_doc":"4) Keep source citations whenever possible for auditability"}

{"_doc":"Notes"}

{"_doc":"- If district/block are included, they help reviewers cross-check ambiguous names."}
{"_doc":"- Keep each entry on a single line and ensure valid UTF-8 JSON. No trailing commas."}
{"_doc":"- This file is NDJSON; comments are stored as objects with _doc keys to remain machine-readable."}
